    <h2 class="section-title" >ANTI CORRUPTION WING</h2>
    <p class="text-justify mb-4 " style="text-align: justify;">
      At the time of independence, a department with the name of Special Police Establishment (SPE) was set up to fight against corruption in Pakistan. In the year 1974, this organization was merged in the newly created Multi Tasked Agency namely FIA and besides Anti-Corruption, a number of other responsibilities were also entrusted to it.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify mb-5"style="text-align: justify;">
      FIA has been engaged in fighting against the menace of Corruption in Pakistan at all the times except for a short period (16.08.2004 to 24.10.2008), during which its powers to deal with the corruption cases were seized by NAB.
